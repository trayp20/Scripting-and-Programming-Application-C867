# Scripting-and-Programming-Application-C867
This C++ application was developed to manage a student roster for a university migration project. It reads, processes, and displays student information, fulfilling essential requirements for maintaining a course roster. The project includes Student and Roster classes, each handling specific data and operations like validating emails, calculating average course completion days, and filtering students by degree program. The Roster class dynamically manages student entries, supporting adding, removing, and displaying detailed student information in a formatted output.

The project demonstrates key programming competencies, including variable management, control structures, arrays, pointers, and object-oriented programming principles. Itâ€™s structured into modular files (e.g., student.cpp, roster.cpp) for easy maintenance and readability. This codebase is suitable for Visual Studio or Xcode, with complete setup provided in a zip file containing all necessary code to compile and run.
